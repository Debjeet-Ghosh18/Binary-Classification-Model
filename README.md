🏥 Insurance Purchase Prediction

This project demonstrates a binary classification machine learning model that predicts whether a person bought insurance based on their age.

The model is stored as a .pkl file and served through a Flask backend with an HTML frontend (index.html). Users can enter their age and get a prediction (Yes or No).
